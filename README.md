# Animated Windows 10 Wallpaper Program

### Function and Description
This is a simple C++ program that ,when compiled on you Windows machine with a compiler like MinGW, will run through the frames of an animated gif(hardcoded frames that you cannot adjust at the moment) and automatically change the wallpaper every 100 milliseconds. The GIF frames are included here (credit to: https://www.reddit.com/user/v78/, original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/bx9mu3/i_drew_this_12_colors_pixelart_animation_and/)

### Future plans
This was a just a fun little side project but if I guess I want to work on this in the future I could add:
- Adjustable framerate
- Ability to just give the program a GIF and it just breaking it into frames for you (probably using the Magik++ library) that it will loop through.
- A UI?
